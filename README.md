# Student Admission Classification with a Simple Neural Network

This project demonstrates a basic neural network model for classifying student admissions based on academic and test data. Built from scratch, the notebook showcases the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- Binary classification of student admission outcomes.
- Data normalization and train-test split.
- Neural network with input, hidden, and output layers.
- Model evaluation using accuracy and loss curves.

## Files
- `StudentAdmissions.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and results.
- `Student_data.csv`: Data set.
